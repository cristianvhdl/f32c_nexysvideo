# f32c_nexysvideo

I'm trying to port f32c/f32c.git (FPGArduino) to Nexys Video (Artix-7).

Based on top_bram.

.xpr file is for Vivado 2016.2 . I believe there are no dependency for the version.

I succeed to generate .bit file but programming failed.

CPU clock is 100MHz. I tried to set 150MHz but timing not meet.

Connect any periferals except switches, buttons and LEDs.
